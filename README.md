# Mini-Operating-System
# A project created in c++
# This project is a pair project which is a basic simulation of an operating system built from scratch using C++. It manages hardware resources like RAM, hard drive, and CPU cores, and allows users to perform multiple tasks such as using a notepad, calculator, viewing time, copying/deleting files, and even playing mini-games. It includes key OS features like multitasking, process scheduling, user/kernel modes, and interrupt handling â€” giving a real feel of how an OS works behind the scenes.
